# Total least squares

For augmented data $C=[A\ b]$, a correction $D=[E\ f]$ is consistent at $x$ when
$(C+D)(x,-1)=0$, equivalently $(A+E)x=b+f$. The domain index `n ⊕ Unit` distinguishes the
right-hand side. The coefficient and observation index types are arbitrary finite types,
and the scalar field is `RCLike`.

The set `totalLeastSquaresCosts C` contains the squared Frobenius norms of corrections
consistent at some finite solution. The predicate `IsTotalLeastSquaresSolution C x` says
that a correction consistent at this particular vector attains the least cost. A caller
with separate coefficient and right-hand-side perturbations can rewrite the two-block
constraint with `fromCols_add_mulVec_eq_zero_iff`.

The infimum equals the last eigenvalue of $C^*C$, indexed by `Fintype.card n`. This
domain-side convention retains zero eigenvalues in wide problems. Equality in the
Rayleigh lower bound identifies the full minimizing eigenspace. Each unit vector $v$
in that eigenspace with nonzero last coordinate gives both a finite solution and the
optimal correction $-(Cv)v^*$. This correction is zero when $Cv=0$. When all minimizing
vectors have last coordinate zero, approximation by vectors with nonzero last coordinate
gives the same infimum.

For a strict gap between the augmented minimum $\mu$ and the least eigenvalue of
$A^*A$, the shifted Gram matrix is positive definite. The first block of the eigenvector
equation gives the unique solution $(A^*A-\mu I)^{-1} A^* b$. This is the statement an
application with a spectral gap can use directly.

The module `NLAlib.Matrix.Pseudoinverse.TotalLeastSquares` uses the existing `eigenvalue`,
`frobNorm`, Rayleigh estimates, and Mathlib's outer products, Euclidean normalization,
`IsGLB`, and `IsLeast`. The resulting public theorems share the atlas id
`total-least-squares-svd`. Their arguments adapt the [original atlas development](https://github.com/tchen-research/NLAlib/blob/77514ce42a0e437d837797a063ac161f41022730/NLAlib/Matrix/Basic/TotalLeastSquares.lean).

## Public signatures

The observation and coefficient types `m` and `n` are finite, and `𝕜` is an `RCLike` field.
