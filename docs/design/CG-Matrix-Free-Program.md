# Matrix-free CG program and shared execution proofs

Target and tree approved by the maintainer on 2026-11-04. The stored-entry CG program, its compiled tree, target and approved counts
remain unchanged. This development adds the separately reviewed oracle variant in
`CGOracleProgramTree.lean`, `CGOracleTargets.lean` and `CGOracleProgram.lean`.

## Program and access model

`cgOracleProg` has the same five declared buffers: b, x, residual, direction and status. It uses
the same cached squared residual, guards, update order and terminal statuses as `cgProg`.
Each active step calls `.apply o tag s 0 p 0 1` in place of the stored dense gemv. Matrix entries
are never read or materialized. The oracle is fixed before the unknown matrix and right-hand
side, as required by the existing `Computation.MatrixFree` model.

The scratch layout reserves an empty buffer at slot5, then product workspace N at slot6 and
nine scalars at slot7. This keeps the existing phase addresses and permits sharing the scalar
and update execution lemmas. The empty slot occupies zero numeric cells and O(1) host metadata;
all memory statements use the existing numeric-cell model. A later layout simplification can
remove the empty slot only through a separately reviewed program/tree change.

The approved target is `MatrixFreeConjugateGradient`, using the existing model and
`cgOracleProg.compiled`. Sizes are unrestricted. Every real matrix and RHS has a successful
guarded exact execution with preserved b and status0/1/-1; for SPD matrices all three output
vectors equal `cgState A b 0 q`, status1 iff the terminal residual is zero, and status-1 is
excluded. Zero dimension, zero RHS and zero budget are included.

## Resources

Per active iteration there is one oracle load and one one-column matvec. Upper counts at a
requested budget q are: load=q, matvec=q, mul/add=N+5qN each, conj=N+2qN, div=2q,
neg=q+1, lit=N+3+2q, cmp=1+3q, copy=2N+2q+2. Every other count is zero. Peak memory is
5N+11 cells at the arithmetic tag, zero elsewhere; it includes declared buffers and scratch.
The oracle implementation's internal memory and arithmetic are outside this black-box count
and must be included by any backend implementation certificate.

The generic StaticCost theorem certifies these resource bounds independently of exact or
rounded scalar correctness. It counts the actual `.apply` as one load plus one matvec.

## Reusing correctness

Reuse the existing `CGState`, scalar-frame and BLAS execution lemmas. The current store context
additionally requires a physically loaded matrix; it cannot be assumed for an oracle program.
A reviewed generalization can distinguish a stored matrix from the zero-length reserved slot,
with the existing dense specialization definitionally retaining all its old conditions.
Common vector/scalar update phases then apply to both backends. Curvature execution is the
backend-specific component: existing dense gemv versus the certified actual oracle application.
Loop invariants and mathematical guard facts are shared. No alternative CG recurrence or
arithmetic-error/run interface is introduced.

The full rounded oracle theorem will use the existing scalar contract and `IsMatvecErr`
separately. Its oracle-accuracy allowance is explicit and is not identified with unit roundoff.
The stored-entry rounded bridge remains the first complete prototype; this oracle variant
reuses its extraction and horizon mathematics after proving the appropriate primitive phases.

## Approval and validation

The maintainer approved the exact builder, compiled tree, count formula and target statement
in `proposals/krylov/CGOracle.lean`. Canonical placement splits the program tree, target and
proofs without changing those reviewed bodies. `CGOracleProgramStaticCost.lean` proves the resource
certificate separately from exact correctness. The final theorem proves the target constant.
The actual compiled tree passed eight Float execution cases, checking all output buffers,
operation kinds, cell/bit bounds and cleanup.

## Shared allocation wrapper

`Computation/Allocation.lean` names the existing allocation/release state updates as
`St.allocate` and `St.release`, and lifts an actual body execution through one scope using
`exec_alloc`. `CGProgramScope.lean` composes that same rule for the actual three allocations,
under arbitrary word carriers, charges and bit widths. The matrix-size expression remains an
`IExp`, preserving the literal stored AST rather than replacing `N*N` by a different constant
node. These are execution helpers, with no numerical postcondition or independent interpreter.
