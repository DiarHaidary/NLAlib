# Proposed CG implementation precision budget

Scalar comparisons for the input-only budget used by the rounded CG execution proposals.
This file contains no program, target, registered result or new arithmetic/run interface.
The canonical program and exact target remain in the library.

## Main results

* `NLAlib.cgImplementationRoundoffBound_nonneg`: nonnegative precision budget.
* `NLAlib.roundingFactor_mul_sqrt_le_cgImplementationRoundoffBound`: product-error allowance.
* `NLAlib.roundingFactor_two_le_cgImplementationRoundoffBound`: vector-update allowance.
