# The store

The store `NLAlib.Computation.Store P K` of a run is a stack of buffers, each with a tag of type
`P` and an array of possibly uninitialised cells over the carrier `K`; a handle is a position in
the stack. Reads and writes fail outside a buffer, at another tag or past its end, and a read
fails at an uninitialised cell. Block reads and writes are reads and writes of consecutive cells.
The shape of a store, the tag and the length of each buffer, decides which writes succeed.

The store lemmas say what a read sees after a write, an allocation (a push), a deallocation (a
pop) or a block write, and when a write succeeds. The frame invariant
`NLAlib.Computation.Store.BlockFrame` is what a kernel or an oracle implementation that writes
one block through a scratch buffer keeps along its loops; popping the scratch buffer then gives
the block write. Design: `docs/design/Computation.md` (D3, D11).

## Main definitions

* `NLAlib.Computation.Store`: the store; `NLAlib.Computation.Store.read`,
  `NLAlib.Computation.Store.write`, `NLAlib.Computation.Store.readBlock`,
  `NLAlib.Computation.Store.writeBlock`, `NLAlib.Computation.Store.shape`.
* `NLAlib.Computation.Store.BlockFrame`: the frame invariant of a block write with a scratch
  buffer.

## Main results

* `NLAlib.Computation.Store.read_of_write_eq_some`,
  `NLAlib.Computation.Store.read_of_write_eq_some_of_ne`: a read after a write.
* `NLAlib.Computation.Store.read_of_writeBlock_eq_some_of_lt`,
  `NLAlib.Computation.Store.read_of_writeBlock_eq_some_of_ne`: a read after a block write.
* `NLAlib.Computation.Store.ext_of_shape_eq`: two stores of the same shape with the same reads
  are equal.
* `NLAlib.Computation.Store.BlockFrame.pop_eq`: popping the scratch buffer from a store in the
  frame of a block write gives the block write.
