# Orthogonality to lower degrees

A real polynomial $p$ is orthogonal to the polynomials of degree less than $k$ in
$L^2(\mu)$ when $\int p\,r\,d\mu = 0$ for every real polynomial $r$ with $\deg r < k$. Monicity
and the degree of $p$ are separate hypotheses where a statement needs them; the predicate is the
hypothesis of Gauss quadrature (`NLAlib.Polynomial.Orthogonal.Gauss`) and the conclusion of the
Ritz-polynomial theorem of Lanczos quadrature. It depends on $\mu$ only through finitely many
moments.

A measure $\mu$ is positive definite on the polynomials of degree less than $k$ when every
nonzero such polynomial has positive $L^2(\mu)$ norm; this is the hypothesis of uniqueness of the
monic orthogonal polynomial, of the reality and simplicity of its zeros and of positive Gauss
weights.

## Main definitions

* `NLAlib.IsMomentPosDef`: positive definiteness on the polynomials of degree less than $k$.

## Main results

* `NLAlib.IsOrthogonalPolynomial.mono`: orthogonality to fewer degrees.
* `NLAlib.MatchesMoments.isOrthogonalPolynomial_iff`: orthogonality depends only on the moments.
* `NLAlib.IsMomentPosDef.mono`: definiteness up to a lower degree.
* `NLAlib.isMomentPosDef_iff_forall_finset`: definiteness counts support points.

/-- The measure $\mu$ is **positive definite on the polynomials of degree less than $k$**:
$\int p^2\,d\mu > 0$ for every nonzero real polynomial $p$ with $\deg p < k$. Equivalently the
Hankel matrix $(\int x^{i+j}\,d\mu)_{i,j<k}$ is positive definite, or $\mu$ has at least $k$
support points (`isMomentPosDef_iff_forall_finset`). Vacuous at $k = 0$. Chihara's
