# A floating-point machine on the grid with unbounded exponent

`NLAlib.gridMachine t` is a `NLAlib.FloatMachine` on stored reals that **decodes a word by
rounding it to nearest onto the $t$-bit grid with unbounded exponent** (`Real.roundNearest t`),
as `NLAlib.Computation.gridSem` does, and rounds every result to that grid: the scalar
operations round the exact result on the decoded operands, the uniform sampler clamps the rounded
$\bar s v$ to $[-\bar s, \bar s]$, the normal sampler rounds both parts, and the two black boxes
`NLAlib.gridMM t`, `NLAlib.gridQR t` compute the exact product (an exact QR factorization, chosen)
of the decoded inputs and round each entry, real and imaginary parts separately, with the odd
rounding `NLAlib.gridRoundOdd` (so that the rounded $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^{\mathsf{H}}$ is exactly
Hermitian: `Real.roundNearest` rounds ties upward and is not odd). It meets the contract
`NLAlib.FloatMachine.IsAccurate` at the decoding `Real.roundNearest t`, with $u = 2^{-t}$, floor
$\tau = 0$, every range $\Omega$, $\mu_{\mathrm{MM}}(d) = \mu_{\mathrm{QR}}(d) = 2d$ and
$c_{\mathrm N} = \sqrt2$, for $t \ge 1$: the companion, on the decoding of the grid semantics, of
`NLAlib.binaryFloatMachine` (bounded exponent, floor $\tau > 0$), which cannot meet a contract
at floor $0$.

The file also gives a part of a rounded witness on the grid: rounding the tape meets
`NLAlib.Computation.IsTapeRounding` with countable range and measurable fibres (with
`Real.abs_roundNearest_le_of_mem_floatGrid`: rounding to nearest does not leave the modulus of a
grid point).

## Main definitions

* `NLAlib.gridRoundOdd`: odd rounding to nearest onto the grid.
* `NLAlib.gridMM`, `NLAlib.gridQR`: the correctly rounded black boxes on stored pairs.
* `NLAlib.gridMachine`: the machine.

## Main results

* `NLAlib.isMatMulErr_gridMM`, `NLAlib.isQRErr_gridQR`, `NLAlib.isAccurate_gridMachine`: the
  contracts.
* `NLAlib.isTapeRounding_roundNearest`, `NLAlib.measurable_roundNearest`: rounding the tape.
