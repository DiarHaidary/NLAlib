# Local guarantee of a node of spectral bisection

A node of the machine
algorithm `NLAlib.eighAux` with a good sample whose children return approximate
diagonalizations returns one itself, with residual $\varepsilon(R + R_0)$ and singular values
within $\varepsilon/3$ of $1$ ([Shah2024, Lemma 4.1]), under the precision budget
`NLAlib.FloatMachine.IsEighNodeBudget`; leaves are treated directly. The assembly of the output
from the children's is in `NLAlib/Matrix/Computation/SpectralBisection/Assembly.lean`.

## Main results

* `NLAlib.FloatMachine.IsAccurate.isApproxDiagonalization_eighAux_succ_of_leaf`: the leaves.
* `NLAlib.FloatMachine.IsAccurate.isApproxDiagonalization_eighAux_succ_of_isEighNodeBudget`:
  Lemma 4.1.
