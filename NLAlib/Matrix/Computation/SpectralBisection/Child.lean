# The children of a node of spectral bisection

A child of a node of
`NLAlib.eighChild` carries the machine's next window and tolerance (`NLAlib.eighNextParams`),
whose rounding is bounded here, and the children of a node with a good sample keep the node
invariant: a Hermitian matrix with $\|\mathbf{A}'\|_2 \le R'$ ([Shah2024, proof of Lemma 4.1]).

## Main results

* `NLAlib.le_eq_false_and_le_and_eq_of_eighChild_eq_some`: the parameters of a child.
* `NLAlib.FloatMachine.IsAccurate.dec_eighNextParams_le`: the rounded next window and tolerance.
* `NLAlib.FloatMachine.IsAccurate.isHermitian_and_specNorm_le_of_eighChild_eq_some`: the child
  invariant.

/-- The parameters of a child: a child $y$ of a node $x$ (`NLAlib.eighChild`) exists only when
the machine's leaf test $R \le \mathrm{fl}(\varepsilon R_0)$ fails; it has size at most $x$'s, and
carries the next window and tolerance of `NLAlib.eighNextParams` and the depth counter
$\ell + 1$. -/
