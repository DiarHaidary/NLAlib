# Outer measure under product projection

For probability measures, a set has real-valued outer measure at most that of its pullback
along the first projection from the product. No measurability of the set is required.
Upstream candidate for `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Prod.lean`.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.measureReal_le_prod_fst`: pullback along the first product projection.
