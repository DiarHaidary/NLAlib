# Jensen's inequality for the second moment

Under a probability measure the mean of a square-integrable real function is at most the square
root of its second moment, $\mathbb{E} f \le (\mathbb{E} f^2)^{1/2}$. This is the step that turns a
second-moment bound into a first-moment one; the library states the second moment and leaves the
first to this lemma (CONTRIBUTING §5.2, T15). Upstream candidate for
`Mathlib.Probability.Moments.Variance`.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.integral_le_sqrt_integral_sq`: $\mathbb{E} f \le \sqrt{\mathbb{E} f^2}$.
