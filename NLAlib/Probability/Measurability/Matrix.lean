# Measurability of matrix quantities

For random matrices, the quantities of the Matrix layer must be measurable functions of the
matrix. This file belongs to the Probability layer: the Matrix layer itself has no measure theory.
Norms, singular values and eigenvalues are continuous, hence measurable. The rank, the
pseudoinverse, the range projector, the pseudo-condition number, the inverse Gram matrix, the
randomized SVD, (generalized) Nyström, the chosen SVD, the truncated SVD, the early-truncated
outputs, the polar factor and the Gram–Schmidt factors are not continuous but are Borel
measurable. The chosen SVD (`NLAlib.svdU`, `NLAlib.svdV`) is measurable by the measurable
selection theorem `IsClosed.measurable_of_forall_toLex_equivFun_le`: it is the lexicographically
least point of the closed set of SVDs.

Matrices carry the product σ-algebra `Matrix.instMeasurableSpace`. A bounded measurable function
of a random matrix is integrable on a finite measure space; the squared projection residuals are
recorded here.

## Main results

* `NLAlib.measurable_specNorm`, `NLAlib.measurable_frobNorm`, `NLAlib.measurable_matrixNorm`.
* `NLAlib.measurable_singularValues`, `NLAlib.measurable_eigenvalue`.
* `NLAlib.measurable_quadForm`, `NLAlib.measurable_rayleighQuotient`: functions of the vector.
* `NLAlib.measurableSet_setOf_posDef`: the positive definite matrices form a measurable set.
* `NLAlib.measurable_rank`, `NLAlib.measurable_pinv`, `NLAlib.measurable_rangeProjector`,
  `NLAlib.measurable_pseudoConditionNumber`.
* `NLAlib.integrable_frobNorm_one_sub_rangeProjector_mul_sq`,
  `NLAlib.integrable_specNorm_one_sub_rangeProjector_mul_sq`: a squared projection residual of a
  random sketch is integrable, being bounded.
* `NLAlib.measurable_mul_conjTranspose_inv`: the inverse Gram matrix
  $(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{A}^{\mathsf{H}})^{-1}$; `NLAlib.measurable_rsvd`,
  `NLAlib.measurable_generalizedNystrom`, `NLAlib.measurable_nystrom`: the randomized SVD and
  (generalized) Nyström as functions of the test matrices.
* `NLAlib.measurable_svdU`, `NLAlib.measurable_svdV`: the chosen SVD;
  `NLAlib.measurable_truncatedSVD`: the truncated SVD. With it every theorem stated for a
  measurable choice of best approximations $\mathbf{Y}$ applies to the truncation of a random
  output, for instance with `hYm := ((measurable_truncatedSVD k).comp_aemeasurable
  ((measurable_rsvd A).comp_aemeasurable hX)).aestronglyMeasurable`.
* `NLAlib.measurable_earlyTruncatedRSVD`, `NLAlib.measurable_earlyTruncatedGeneralizedNystrom`:
  the early-truncated randomized SVD and generalized Nyström, built from the truncated SVD of the
  sketch.
* `NLAlib.measurable_polarFactor`, `NLAlib.measurable_gramSchmidtQ`.
