# Yao's principle for query algorithms

A randomized algorithm is a measurable family of deterministic ones indexed by a seed
(`NLAlib.QueryAlgorithm.IsMeasurableFamily`). Two forms of Yao's minimax principle (the easy
direction, which is what lower bounds use), both Fubini on the product of the seed law and the
input law (`docs/design/Probability-MatvecQueryModel.md`, §3.2):

* distributional: if every measurable deterministic algorithm has failure probability at most
  $\delta$ on a random input, so does every randomized one whose seed is independent of the input;
* worst case: if every measurable deterministic algorithm fails with probability at least
  $\delta$ under an input law, every randomized algorithm fails with probability at least
  $\delta$ on some input.

Failure (or success) is membership of the pair (input, output) in a measurable set `B`.

/-- **Yao's principle, distributional form**: let the seed $s$ be independent of the random input
$X$, and let $B$ be a measurable set of (input, output) pairs. If every measurable deterministic
algorithm puts $(X, \text{output})$ in $B$ with probability at most $\delta$, then so does the
randomized algorithm with seed $s$:
$\mathbb{P}[(X, \mathcal{A}_s(X)) \in B] \le \delta$.
[Yao1977, Section 3]; there as the minimax principle for finite problems, here the averaging
half on a probability space, any seed and input spaces, any oracle depending measurably on the
input. -/

/-- **Yao's principle, worst-case form**: let $\rho$ be a seed law and $\nu$ an input law, both
probability measures, and $B$ a measurable set of (input, output) pairs. If every measurable
deterministic algorithm has $\nu$-probability at least $\delta$ of $(x, \text{output}) \in B$,
then for the randomized algorithm some input $x$ has
$\rho$-probability at least $\delta$ of $(x, \mathcal{A}_s(x)) \in B$. Read with $B$ the failure
set: a lower bound against one input distribution is a lower bound for randomized algorithms in
the worst case.
